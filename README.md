OpenID Connect module for SimpleSAMLphp

## Developer notes/Known issues

- This library uses a fork of the OpenID Connect package by ivan-novakov, until
  [this pull request](https://github.com/ivan-novakov/php-openid-connect-client/pull/11)
  and others are merged upstream. You will have to copy over the repository definition
  to your project's root composer.json file.
